Given the source code of a function and a list of function names that may be called by it and could have side-effects, you need to determine whether those given side-effect calls occur only within error-handling branches (e.g., branches taken when malloc fails, the allocation size is invalid, the function returns NULL, or memory is freed on failure).\n\n- Output \"YES\" if all side-effects occur only in error-handling branches.\n\n- Output \"NO\" if any side-effect occurs in non error-handling execution path, or if you cannot determine with certainty that all side-effects are confined to error-handling branches.\n\nYou do not need to understand what the side-effects are or what they do. You only need to check whether they occur exclusively in error-handling code paths.",
